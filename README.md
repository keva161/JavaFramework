# JAVA POM Framework

A Selenium webdriver framework built with an interpretation of the page object model.

Still in development so feel free to follow along development as I add new features.

Current features:

- JUnit testing and custom rules for before/after tests.
- Logging with LogBack.

Todo:

- Add API testing abilities.
- Add HTML reports.
- Add remote running of tests.
- Add CI support with Jenkins.
